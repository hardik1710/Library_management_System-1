# Library_management_System
 The project aims to develop a system that maintains and organizes the librarian's work. The librarian will be able to keep track of the number of books in the inventory, add new books and delete books from the inventory. The librarian can also search for the details of a particular book. The librarian can also keep track of issuing and returning books. Students have a separate login option where they can register themselves and login. After successful login, they can view the available books and also view the list of books that has been issued to them.
